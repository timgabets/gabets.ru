Hi, I'm üîêtimgabets. I am a software developer, primarily working now with payment card processing software in the Fintech area, but I'm also still practicing some JavaScript and Python for my personal projects. I'm currently employed by Tinkoff Bank where I work as a Lead software developer.

In the past I worked for TSYS and BPC as well as some other smaller projects, sometimes even not related to software engineering.

I earned my Bachelor Degree in Computer Science in Moscow Tech in 2016. Also in the past I successfully completed some graduate courses at Harvard Extension School, which I'm still very proud of.

If you happen to have any questions or just would like to contact me, you can do this by email. You can also find me on Github, LinkedIn, Goodreads and Instagram.

My GPG key is CD5A97B2 registered using Email address tim@gabets.ru. Other keys registered on my name are no longer in use.
