I'm doing software engineering for a living. And also I'm playing amateur rugby. And one of the things that makes me laughing out of loud is [Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)) (in the context of software development) which is one of the magic Agile terms:

> They called this the holistic or rugby approach, as the whole process is performed by one cross-functional team across multiple overlapping phases, where the team "tries to go the distance as a unit, passing the ball back and forth".


Probably, the guys that named it _scrum_ were keeping in mind the _maul_ - the action when the ball is held by one or more opponents, and one or more of the ball carrier's teammates bind on the ball carrier. Once a maul has formed other players may join in but, as in a ruck, they must do so from their own side.

So, this is the maul:

And this is what actually the scrum is - a way of restarting the game safely and fairly after a minor infringement:

> Scrums are one of the most dangerous phases in rugby, since a collapse or improper engage can lead to a front row player damaging or even breaking his neck.

Now you know the difference.
